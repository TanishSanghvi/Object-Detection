# Object-Detection

Detect features from various YouTube thumbnails to build and test various hypothesis

## ABOUT

The goal of the project is to create an unsupervised clustering software that can help companies/stakeholders understand the taste/preferences of their target audience.

YouTube API is used to extract information relevant to users in a particular domain post which  data processing, NLP tools (TF-IDF, N-grams) and clustering modules are applied to generate insightful wordclouds

The final results and graphs and insights are present in 'User Hack Report.docx'

## BUILT WITH / MODULES USED

Built with Python 3.7. Modules used:
 - Python 3.7
 - GoogleVision API
 - NLP
 - VADER
 - CV2
 - ExtraTreesClassifier
 - ANOVA
 - Decision Trees

## USE CASES
 - By leveraging the ability to detect features in images/thumbnails and test their significance, content creators can get a better picture of what works (drives engagements/impressions) and what does not.
 - A decision tree with its rules can also give a blueprint of the list of features that a thumbnail can/should utilise
 - By building a market basket analysis on top of this, one can also see what kind of features work well.
